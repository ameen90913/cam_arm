# Cam Arm

## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a real-time hand gesture recognition system that detects and tracks hand movements using Mediapipe and Opencv and communicates the recognized gestures to an Arduino for further actions. It also demonstrates the integration of computer vision for gesture recognition with hardware control based on hand gestures.
